## Overview

**Hosting Toolkit Scripts** is a collection developed by **Average Joe's Hosting LLC** comprising essential scripts designed to streamline and automate common tasks for web hosting and server management. These scripts are perfect for web administrators aiming to enhance their efficiency with simple yet powerful automation tools. This toolkit is continuously evolving, with more tools planned to be added over time.

## 📜 Features

### 🔧 Scripts Included

1. **[Backup Script](BackupScript/)**
   - Automates the backup of a website's files and MySQL database. The files are compressed into a tarball and stored in a designated backup directory. This script can be easily modified to support cloud storage options.

2. **[SSL Certificate Renewal Reminder](SSLCertificateRenewalReminder/)**
   - Monitors the expiration date of an SSL certificate for a specified domain and sends an email reminder if the certificate is due to expire within 30 days.

3. **[Uptime Monitoring Script](UptimeMonitoring/)**
   - Pings a specified website or server at regular intervals to check its availability. Logs the uptime status, including timestamps for when the host is up or down.

4. **[Cron Job Setup Script](CronJobSetup/)**
   - Easily adds a new cron job to the crontab, simplifying the process of scheduling regular tasks like backups, updates, or maintenance.

5. **[Disk Space Check Script](DiskSpaceCheck/)**
   - Monitors disk space usage on a specified partition and sends an alert email if the usage exceeds a set threshold.

### 🌟 Future Tools

We plan to add more scripts to this toolkit, covering a broader range of hosting and server management tasks. Stay tuned for updates!
